        <br>created through the Dialogue this piece is has never failed to impress.
        <br>
        <br>It was Originally performed in 2008 at the Dorfman (formally known as 'Cottesloe Theatre'), the staging form used in the performance 
        <br>was End On however the Dorfman could be configured to an In-The-Round or Thrust form.
